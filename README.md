# Hotel-Management-System---Data-Structures
Data Structures are the building blocks of every efficient program. There are several
data structures widely used for problem solving, be it array, stack, queue, linked lists,
etc. To create the backend working mechanism of the program, we have decided to use
linked list. Our project provides a common platform for both customers as well as staff
of the hotel. This makes the conduction of hotel management fluid and automated thus
reducing manual work. Throughout the implementation of the project we have created
every operation using linked list only to understand all the principal operations on linked
lists like insertion of nodes at various position, deletion of nodes at different positions,
searching elements in the list and updation of elements in the list. Our program serves
as a common application to three types of operators: customer, receptionist and
manager. We have provided ample amount of operation for each person to operate.
The customers can check in, update their details; the receptionist can check room
availability and the manager can change the cost and number of available rooms in the
hotel. Our program is user-friendly and provides accurate and error free output.
